<p>Part of me wonders if this is part of the romance dynamic. It certainly shows up a lot in romances, so much so that I always read a bit to see if this will be one of those "the woman is so stupid and willful, but the man brings her to heel" ones before spending any money. I have a couple that are positively abusive - I remember one where he would constantly insult and nitpick at her, even when she was deliriously ill, and refused her the right to leave the house all because he "loved" her but though she'd killed his younger brother, so he "hated" her too! By the time I reached the end, I felt sincerely nauseous, but it's clear that there is a population of women for whom this somehow rings true enough to write and to read!</p>
<p><a href="http://kenobi.herokuapp.com/">Kenobi</a> was a perfect combo project for me. I got to explore machine learning, use some of the skills I picked up at the awesome <a href="https://scraperwiki.com/">ScraperWiki</a> class on web scraping I took a while back, and create a tool I&#8217;d actually use to improve my ability to help others. Right on.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a huge fan of <a href="http://ask.metafilter.com/">Ask Metafilter</a>, a community where folks ask questions (shocking, no?) and answer questions asked by others. <a href="http://www.thingswemake.com/">My fabulous brother</a> got there first, and I appreciate that he dragged me in with him. It can be a bit overwhelming, though. I don&#8217;t really have the time to skim through all the questions that get posted, especially since so many of them are about things where I have no useful information or advice to give. It sure would be helpful if something pared the list down to only the questions where my answers would be most likely to actually help others, right? Right!</p>
<p>Well, even if he is referring to ALL women, I don't think atbash is saying that they intimidate him on purpose. His anxiety sounds like it comes from a combination of being introverted, bad past experiences, and sensitivity to stereotypes. Most importantly, he is aware of this, which is crucial to being able to change it.</p>
